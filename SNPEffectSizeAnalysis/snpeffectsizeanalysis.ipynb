    "SNPs linked to three specific diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Type 2 Diabetes) are analyzed for significance in effect size of those SNPs with respect to the corresponding disease. The average effect size for the specific disease is calculated for the linked SNPs to that disease. Then, many random samples of SNPs from the entire dataset are formed and the average effect size for each of those samples is calculated. A p-value is obtained for significance of the effect size of the specific disease SNPs given the distribution of the random samples' effect sizes and the effect sizes of both the disease linked SNPs and the random samples are plotted for a visual representation. Linked SNPs are obtained from the file \"snapfiltered.associations.new2.tsv\" which contain SNPs from the original \"associations.new.tsv\" file but with filtered out SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium with known SNPs from the original \"associations.known.tsv\" file. SNPs in linkage disequilibrium were determined by using the SNAP online tool at http://archive.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearchpw.php with an r^2 threshold of 0.9 and using SNP data from the 1000 Genomes Pilot 1 data set with a population panel of CEU."
